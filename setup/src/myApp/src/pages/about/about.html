    <a href="https://appiko.org"> Appiko </a> is an early stage start-up focused on developing technology for wildlife conservation. 
</p>
<p>
We are working to create low cost, low power, modular hardware and software components that can give wildlife researchers, conservationists, and communities in the human-animal-conflict zone options and solutions to monitor, manage and understand their environment. 
 </p>
 <p>
All the technology developed by Appiko is free and open source. 
</p>
<p>
At present, we are working on creating a distributed system of sensor units that can accurately detect elephants and generate alerts over a long distance to prevent human-elephant conflicts. The products in this suite include  PIR based motion sensors, active beam sensors,  and a wireless protocol to enable communication between these sensors and other end points like mobile phones.
</p>
<p>
Appiko is also engaged with providing engineering  services to organisations and individuals working on wildlife conservation or allied fields.
